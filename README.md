A web-based application designed to facilitate course reservations for students and administrators.

## 📌 Features

- User Authentication (Login/Signup)
- Course Listing and Viewing
- Course Reservation and Cancellation
- Admin Panel to manage courses and users

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- **Backend**: Node.js, Express.js
- **Database**: MongoDB (with Mongoose)
- **Other Tools**: dotenv for environment variables, Express Router

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
- [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/)

# 🏗 Technical Architecture

The Course Reservation System is designed using a **Model-View-Controller (MVC)** architecture to separate concerns, improve maintainability, and scale efficiently.

---

## 🧩 Components Overview

### 1. **Frontend (View)**
- **Tech Stack**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- **Location**: `/Html/`
- **Responsibilities**:
  - Present user interfaces for login, signup, course browsing, and admin actions
  - Send user actions (form submissions, button clicks) to backend via HTTP requests

---

### 2. **Backend (Controller + Business Logic)**
- **Tech Stack**: Node.js, Express.js
- **Location**: `/routes/`, `server.js`
- **Responsibilities**:
  - Handle HTTP requests and responses
  - Route user interactions to appropriate services
  - Perform authentication and validation
  - Control logic for course reservation, user session, etc.

---

### 3. **Database Layer (Model)**
- **Tech Stack**: MongoDB + Mongoose ODM
- **Location**: `/models/`
- **Responsibilities**:
  - Define schemas for users, courses, and reservations
  - Interact with MongoDB to store and retrieve application data

---

## 🔁 Data Flow

1. **User interacts with frontend** (e.g., selects a course to reserve).
2. **Frontend sends request** (e.g., POST /reserve-course) to the backend.
3. **Express route handler processes the request**, performs logic, and interacts with the database.
4. **Database returns response** (e.g., reservation success/failure).
5. **Backend sends response** to frontend for rendering.

---

## ⚙️ System Dependencies

- **Node.js**: JavaScript runtime for the backend server
- **Express.js**: Web framework for routing and middleware
- **MongoDB**: NoSQL database for storing users, courses, and reservations
- **dotenv**: Manages environment variables
- **Mongoose**: MongoDB object modeling for Node.js

---

## 🛡 Security Considerations

- Password hashing with bcrypt or similar (if implemented)
- Use of environment variables to store sensitive configs
- Input validation and sanitization to prevent injection attacks
- Authentication middleware to protect admin routes

---

## 🔧 Future Enhancements (Suggested)

- Use a frontend framework (e.g., React) for better UI control
- Add JWT-based authentication for stateless login
- Implement role-based access control (admin vs. user)
- Add unit and integration tests

            Project-related courses are practical, hands-on learning programs that focus on building real-world projects while teaching essential concepts and skills. Instead of relying solely on theory, these courses guide learners through the process of creating actual applications, designs, or business modelsâ€”helping them understand how concepts are applied in real scenarios. Whether it's developing a website, designing a mobile app, analyzing a dataset, or creating a business plan, learners gain valuable experience that enhances their portfolios and boosts their confidence. These courses are especially useful for students, job seekers, and professionals who want to become job-ready by demonstrating their skills through tangible work.
